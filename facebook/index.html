        <span>Introduction</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Facebook is a social media platform / social media networking service founded by Mark Zuckerberg and some of his fellow students and roommates of Harvard College in 2004. They created it to allow students of the university he attended to be able to connect and talk to each other on the internet. The response was far bigger and more positive than Zuckerberg initially thought it would be and by the end of 2005 Facebook had expanded to over 2,000+ universities in a range of different countries. Finally, on the 26th of September, 2006 anyone could sign up to Facebook as long as they were over the age of 13.  Today, more than one billion people are signed up to Facebook and over 60 million business have dedicated pages to allow them to talk about their company. The success of Facebook is primarily the reason why social media is such a big part to play in peoples day to day life and Zuckerberg saw an opportunity for a new innovation that has now let him grow his business to roughly £356.2 Billion.

        <br>
        Facebook allows its users to post messages to their timeline so that their friends and followers can see it. This can be things such as activities in their day, news of what happened, or a funny fact, pretty much anything the user wishes. This is beneficial for businesses as they can use this feature to inform and engage their users to click on their page, follow them, and potentially even use their good or service. A real-life example of this would be like when Deloitte posted a quote saying “When we’re all in it together”.
        <br>
        <br>
        As well as messages, you are able to post photos and videos to your timeline so that your followers can see them. This allows people to do a wide range of things such as post memes, funny videos, informative videos and get information across quickly and easily. This means organisations have many different ways to get across information and news about their company. A real-life example of this would be when Facebook themselves posted an interview with Nicola Mendelsohn.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>Advertising</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Facebook puts ads on their site in peoples timelines as well as on the side of the webpage, these ads are often relevant to the user and match what they have been previously looking at or be interested in. Organisations pay Facebook to have these ads on their site. This is beneficial for businesses as they can promote their company and be reassured that it will be shown to people who will have an interest in them rather than people who will close the ad without thinking twice. Ada College could use this to advertise job openings and student recruitment. The rules and regulations around posting ads have now become a lot stricter as prior to this offensive and malicious adverts have appears on peoples timelines, for example, an advert of an 18+ adult game appearing on a 13-year-olds facebook page.
        <br>
        <br>
        Facebook also allows users to post adverts themselves, known as indirect advertising. An example of this would be if Coca-Cola posted a new drink on their own timeline. This is beneficial for organisations as they can advertise things for free and know that it will be seen by people who are interested in them.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>Information</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Organisations can use Facebook to announce new products or services that they offer to their customers in the hope that they will attract more people to their businesses. An example of this is when Cadbury announced that there is a chance of getting a white cream egg when you open the wrapper. Facebook is good for this because when you post something, everyone who is following you will see what they have put up.
        <br>
        <br>
        They can also use it to tell people about faults of bugs that have happened that may delay or prevent people doing something with their service, this is beneficial as it will keep people informed and calm so they don't have to panic about something going wrong.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>Humorous Content</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Facebook gives users the ability to post photos to their site which means people can post memes and funny photos. Organisations can tailor these memes to their organisation so when people see them they unconsciously think of the company, making the organisation grow a bigger audience.
        <br>
        <br>
        You're also allowed to post messages to your timeline of any content, so organisations can post things that are funny and will make people enjoy being on your timeline, consequently in them potentially following you. An example of this is Wendy’s; the fast food restaurant, who often post things that are making Mcdonalds look worse than them in a jokey way.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>Special Offers</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Organisations can post discount codes onto their Facebook timeline for people to use. For example, Coca-Cola giving a code that lets you have a free drink. This is beneficial for organisations as doing promotions like these will entice people to their page and in turn, create a wider range of people who follow you and see what you post.
        <br>
        <br>
        They can also post pictures of clues to a special offer. For example, posting a picture of a location and a time, and then if someone goes there they can get a free / discounted product. Again, this will entice people to their page making them gain a bigger and wider following.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>Customer Service</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Facebook offers the ability to write, view and respond to private messages. Therefore if someone is having difficulty with your good or service they can message your organisation and a member of staff can get back to them to fix the problem, or advise them what they need to do next.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>Stats</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Facebook is the 3rd most visited website in the world</li>
          <li>68% of Americans use Facebook</li>
          <li>1.1 billion Facebook users speak English</li>
          <li>There are 2.3 billion monthly active users</li>
          <li>30% of users are aged between 25-34 years old</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <span>Audience Profile</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        The average user would be in their late 20’s to early ’30s, we know this because 30% of the people who use Facebook are in this small age range. The reason for so many people of this age using Facebook is probably because when Facebook came about they would have been in their early teens so would have most likely seen it as the new, cool, hipster thing. The reason Facebook probably has al older age range and makes younger users shy away from it is because due to it being around for so long, almost everyone is one it; including young peoples adults. Most teenagers dont want their parents seeing what they are doing online so they tend not to use Facebook as much.
        <br>
        <br>
        The divide between male and female users is fairly similar, with 52% of the userbase being female. Therefore the target audience can be male or female.
