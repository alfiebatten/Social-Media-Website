        Twitter's main function is the ability to let people tweet. This means they post something on their page that can be viewed, liked, retweeted and shared across the site. This is the building blocks for everything that is posted on Twitter and allows organisations to share information and news about their company. A real-life example of this is when Borderlands post a code to use in the game.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is also a retweet button allowing a tweet from another person to be put onto their profile. This allows tweets to go viral and to be seen by a lot of people while still being able to see who the initial person was who retweeted it. This is very useful for organisations because they can promote something. An example of this is a video of Theresa May dancing being retweeted by hundreds of thousands of people.

        Twitter Analytics is a tool that enables people to see their ‘progress’ on the site. They are able to see things like the number of engagements, the number of followers they have gained, etc, and compare them to what they were like last month. This is very useful for businesses as they are able to see if they are reaching more people to expand their audience and to check if their aims and goals have been met.
        <br>
        <br>
        If an organisation wanted to get in touch with someone without everyone seeing, or just wanted to help one person out, they could do this using Twitter direct messages. This is a tool that allows you to message another user of Twitter or multiple users of Twitter (using groups) without the whole site being able to see what you have said. This is useful for an organisation as they can deal with complaints and help people out, without everyone else being involved with it. They are also able to talk to other big companies to arrange new and exciting projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        Within the home page of Twitter, there is a section that users can click on called ‘Moments’. This then brings you to a page outlining what are the most talked about things on Twitter at that moment and in Twitter's terms, “what's happening”. Following this as an organisation is very useful as it means they can relate their tweets to current trends and popularities, in an attempt to reach as many new people as possible. This could also pose as a risk to organisations, however, as they may tweet about something controversial. The top ‘moment’ at the moment is ‘a look into the new Lego movie’.

        One of the main functions of Twitter, and what potentially made it grow to what it is today as well as being able to easily promote things to new people, is the hashtag (#). This feature acts as a link to view other tweets that have used the same hashtag. For example, if someone was to tweet. “Can't wait for deadline day #friday.” anyone who searches for #friday will be able to find their tweet, This, in turn, makes it very easy for organisations to reach new people as they can use hashtags that will not only entice people but will also spread their tweet to areas of Twitter that they have not been to. An example of a very popular hashtag used by thousands of people is the #friyay.

        <span>Advertising</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Twitter put promoted tweets on peoples timeline so that more people are able to view them and more engagements are made. Promoting a tweet is relatively easy, you have to option to promote it when you initially post it; after paying money. Therefore if an organisation wants to reach a bigger audience they can do so very easily by spending money on advertising to have their tweet put on peoples timelines. An advertisement that I have seen come up on my timeline is an apprenticeship agency, which is relevant to me as recently I have been searching for apprenticeships,

        Twitter also offers indirect advertising, through sponsors and hashtags. A twitter account can decide to post something that is sponsored or get someone else to do it. Or they can use hashtags in their tweets that will allow them to reach more people. Either of these options is good for an organisation as they will allow them to reach a bigger audience, however, if they get someone else to sponsor them it will cost them money.

        <span>Information</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Twitter allows people to start threads, which is a bunch of tweets that are all organised together. This can be used to provide information as you can have all your guides in a thread named guides. This makes it very easy for people to quickly navigate to where they want to be. It is also very beneficial for an organisation as it makes them look professional and keeps their social media organised.
        <br>
        <br>
        You are also able to put a description on your profile. This can be anything from a quote to a link and is used to summarise your page as a whole. Organisations can use this to provide information as they can summarise their whole company or social media page in one easy place. An example of this is Kings College’s twitter description, which is “King's (est. 1441): a dynamic & diverse community committed to intellectual excellence & development of new knowledge, with a world-famous Chapel & Choir”

        <span>Humorous Content</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Twitter is often referred to as the home of where memes are made and this is because of the wide range of humorous content that comes out of the platform. An example of this is the multiple viral new dance moves that a large number of young teens seem to recreate.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many people share funny stories that have happened in a tweet and due to the retweet button, they become viral. This then attracts a lot of attention and so they link their other social media to gain more followers across the board. Organisations can do this by posting funny stories that have happened by to their employees in the hope it will go viral.
        <br>
        <br>
        Twitter also allows you to add gifs images and videos to your tweets. This enables people to create all sorts of content that people would find funny. For example, finding that gif that sums up everything that has been said into a 1-second video. Organisations can jump on to this trend of using gifs as people often enjoy them and like tweets that contain gifs.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>Special Offers</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Many companies decide to post promotional of discount codes on their twitter pages. This is so people are more inclined to follow them and watch out for what they post. This is a very good idea as there is a higher chance the organisation's follower count will grow and they will receive more overall engagements. A real-life example of this is the Steam twitter page announcing that their spring sale is one, where games can be purchased for a cheaper price.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>Customer Service</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Lots of people like to tweet about delays and issues they have had with a particular service, these tweets can often go viral and cause a lot of bad publicity for certain organisations. Organisations can use Twitter to provide customer service by having a specific employee or possibly even a team of employees who manage to deal with complaints on Twitter. This then would hopefully stop bad tweets about the organisation going viral as they will be resolved before they do so.
        <br>
        <br>
        Organisations can also use the direct messaging feature to privately message customers to sole disputes, or use the @ to mention the customer's username in a tweet. This makes it very easy to resolve disputes as you can message them within a few clicks, saving the organisation a lot of time and effort.

        <span>Stats</span>
        <ul>
          <li>The first ever tweet was “just setting up my twttr”, sent by Jack Dorsey on the 21st of March 2006</li>
          <li>There are around 261 million Twitter accounts, with 79% of them being out of the US</li>
          <li>Only 2.12% of Twitter profiles have more than 1,000 followers</li>
          <li>Twitter reached its peak revenue in Q3 of 2017, $590</li>
          <li>Twitter only started making a profit in the last quarter of 2017</li>

        <span>Audience Profile</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        The average Twitter user would be in their late teens or 20’s. This is because 37% of Twitter users are between 18 and 29. This is probably because Twitter is harder to use than other social media platforms such as Snapchat and Instagram, so the younger social media users may not want to learn how to effectively use it. It is also important to note that the reason so many 18-year-olds are on Twitter could be because people who are younger than 18 have lied about their age.
        <br>
        <br>
        The average Twitter use would also be a Male. this is because according to a survey conducted in January 2019, 65.5% of Twitter users are Male. They will also often have a university degree and earn higher than the average wage in the US.
